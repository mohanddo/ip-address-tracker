## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS Modules](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [leaflet] (https://leafletjs.com/) - This api provide the map
- [React leaflet] - (https://leafletjs.com/) - This api provides bindings between React and Leaflet
- [IP Geolocation API] - (https://geo.ipify.org/) - I used this api to get the ip address, and other important information

### What I learned

I learned to work with external apis.

### Continued development

I definitely need to work more with the Fetch API, and asynchronous javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Asynchronous js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) - This is a really code introduction to asynchronous js, with an exercise to test your understanding at the end
